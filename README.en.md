# MetaOnticVideo

[简体中文](./README.md)

A DeepSeek Harness plugin for **beginner-friendly video creation and a low-cost long-video workflow**.

## Start creating videos quickly

Describe what you want to make and follow the assistant through your first video, without first learning prompting or editing workflows.

1. **Share your idea**: start with a brief thought or a complete concept. Any refinement stays true to your original idea.
2. **Review the script**: read what will be filmed, ask for changes in plain language, then confirm production.
3. **Watch the result**: preview the generated video and keep the finished file locally.

For example: “Make a 30-second vertical 720P video showing a peaceful lake at dawn.” Duration, orientation and resolution already supplied are reused; only missing details are requested.

## A low-cost long-video workflow

Use **segment generation → continuation → local merging** to make videos beyond the model’s single-call duration limit.

- Review each result before continuing to the next segment.
- Keep and reuse completed segments, pause and resume saved progress, and avoid starting over.
- Merge completed segments locally with FFmpeg while retaining the original clips.

Bring your own API key. Image and video calls are billed by the chosen provider, with cost confirmation before each new segment.

## Online installation

Paste an online installation URL into Harness → Plugins → Add plugin. Windows and macOS use the same package.

Open plugin settings, choose **MetaOntic AI**, enter your API key and save. Select **视频创作助手** in a conversation to begin; **宣传视频助手** is also available for product, brand or event content. Both assistants share the production workflow. Standard mode remains general-purpose.

## Plugin architecture

Agents declare their business dependencies; the shared framework assembles them. Both existing assistants use the video module. New business modules can be added independently.

### Infinite Canvas

The workflow canvas is built into this plugin: no other canvas plugin and no canvas data root are required.

Video creation automatically creates a workflow canvas: the project is created once requirements are confirmed, the full script and production segment plan are synchronized after review, and generated media is published back automatically. Open the workflow canvas as its own page from the left sidebar (a compact copy is also embedded in the video panel); it shows nodes and edges. Drag the background to pan, scroll to zoom, drag nodes to move (a multi-selection moves together), Shift+drag to marquee-select and Shift+click to add to the selection, and create a new canvas, add or duplicate text/image/video nodes, edit their content, connect or disconnect edges, delete nodes, rename the canvas, or export it as JSON. Nodes, edges, reference assets and results are stored in the plugin's own data directory (`~/.dsh/metaontic-video/canvas`).

Press Make on an image or video node to run the whole step inside the canvas: fill in the content, ratio, duration and resolution, review the plan and estimated cost, then confirm the plan and the cost separately before any model call. Review the result on the canvas and, once approved, extend it into the next segment. Cost and result review stay inside the canvas with no chat round-trip, and API keys stay in MetaOnticVideo. Each video node runs one segment (up to 15 seconds for 2.0 or 30 seconds for 2.5); images currently support one square image per call. Failed publishing can be retried and an unconfirmed task can only be queried, never regenerated. The assistant-based video_canvas workflow remains available for full script creation, and existing script, cost and segment reviews remain required.
